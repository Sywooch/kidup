Questionnairre

Target: find out what aspects of KidUp is most attractive to people, why they would be motivated for using it and how they would ideally do so.

Aspects that are covered:
- Platform (mobile/tablet vs desktop and mobile website vs app)
- What does (or would) motivate people intrinsicly to use kidup, devided under
	- Community (direct communication or more traditional community)
	- Sustainability
	- Financially
- What higher goal would be most interesting for KidUp to deliver? (as in, Apple does't just sell computers, they sell you a lifestyle)
	- ?

Plan: send this out to all our existing users, split testing it with intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (tell them they are important to us, we need them to be able to improve our platform) vs handing them a prize / credit / something of direct value. Also ask is to non-users (slightly different question set). Questionaire is anonymous and should not take more then 3 min to fill in.
