                about you.
                If you do not agree to any part of this Privacy Policy, then we cannot provide the Platform to you, and
                you
                should stop accessing the Platform and deactivate your KidUp account. You do so, by contacting us at
                support@kidup.dk
                <br/><br/>
                <strong><em>DEFINITIONS</em></strong>
                <br/>
                Where the definition of a term does not appear in this Privacy Policy (such as “Listing”, “Item”,
                “Content”
                etc.), it shall be given its definition as outlined in our Terms of Service (
                <a href="http://www.kidup.dk/terms"><em>http://www.kidup.dk/terms</em></a>).
                <br/>
                “<strong>Aggregated information</strong>” means information about all of our users or specific groups or
                categories of users
                that we combine together and which does not include the users’ Personal Information. <br/>
                &quot;<strong>Data Controller</strong>&quot; means KidUp, the company responsible for the use of and
                processing of Personal
                Information. <br/>
                &quot;<strong>Personal Information</strong>&quot; means information relating to a living individual who
                is or can be identified
                either from that information or from that information in conjunction with other information that is in,
                or is
                likely to come into, the possession of the Data Controller. <br/><br/>
                <strong><em>WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DOES KIDUP GATHER ABOUT ITS USERS?</em></strong><br/>
                <strong>1. Information that you give us</strong><br/>
                We receive, store and process information that you make available to us when accessing or using our
                Platform.
                Examples include when you:
                <ol>
                    <li>fill in any form on the Platform, such as when you register or update the details of your user
                        account;
                    </li>
                    <li>access or use the Platform, such as to search for or post Items, make or accept bookings, pay
                        for Items,
                        book or
                        pay for any associated services that may be available (such as but not limited to cleaning),
                        post
                        comments or
                        reviews, or communicate with other users;
                    </li>
                    <li>link your account on a third party site (e.g. Facebook) to your KidUp account, in which case we
                        will
                        obtain the
                        Personal Information that you have provided to the third party site, to the extent allowed by
                        your
                        settings with
                        the third party site and authorized by you; and
                    </li>
                    <li>communicate with KidU</li>
                </ol>

                <strong>2. Log Data</strong><br/>
                We may also receive, store and process Log Data, which is information that is automatically recorded by
                our
                servers whenever you access or use the Platform, regardless of whether you are registered with KidUp or
                logged
                in to your KidUp account, such as your IP Address, the date and time you access or use the Platform, the
                hardware and software you are using, referring and exit pages and URLs, the number of clicks, pages
                viewed and
                the order of those pages, and the amount of time spent on particular pages. <br/><br/>
                <strong>3. Cookies, and other Tracking Technologies</strong><br/>
                KidUp uses cookies and other similar technologies on the Platform. We may also allow our business
                partners to
                use their cookies and other tracking technologies on the Platform. As a result, when you access or use
                the
                Platform, you will provide or make available certain information to us and to our business partners.
                While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, we do not change our practices
                in
                response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application. We track
                your
                activities if you click on advertisements for KidUp services on third party platforms such as search
                engines and
                social networks, and may use analytics to track what you do in response to those advertisements.
                We may, either directly or through third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services
                to us,
                also continue to track your behavior on our own Platform for purposes of our own customer support,
                analytics,
                research, product development, fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation,
                as well
                as to enable you to use and access the Platform and pay for your activities on the Platform. We may
                also, either
                directly or through third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us, track
                your
                behavior on our own Platform to market and advertise our services to you on the Platform and third party
                websites. Third parties that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted
                advertisements on
                our Platform and/or third party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements by
                opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative (
                <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"
                   class="uri">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (<a
                    href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/"
                    class="uri">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>). You may also be able to control advertising
                cookies
                provided by publishers, for example Google’s Ad Preference Manager (
                <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/"
                   class="uri">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>). Please note that even if you choose to
                opt-out
                of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising on the Platform – it just will not
                be
                tailored to your interests.
                Third parties may not collect information about users’ online activities on the Platform except as
                described in
                this policy and our Cookie Policy. <br/>
                <strong>4. Third-party social plugins</strong><br/>
                Our Platform may use social plugins which are provided and operated by third-party companies, such as
                Facebook’s
                Like Button.
                As a result of this, you may send to the third-party company the information that you are viewing on a
                certain
                part of our Platform. If you are not logged into your account with the third-party company, then the
                third party
                may not know your identity. If you are logged into your account with the third-party company, then the
                third
                party may be able to link information about your visit to our Platform to your account with them.
                Similarly,
                your interactions with the social plugin may be recorded by the third party.
                Please refer to the third party’s privacy policy to find out more about its data practices, such as what
                data is
                collected about you and how the third party uses such data. <br/><br/>
                <strong><em>HOW KIDUP USES AND PROCESSES THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE OR MAKE
                        AVAILABLE</em></strong><br/>
                We use and process Information about you for the following general purposes:
                <ol>
                    <li>to enable you to access and use the Platform;</li>
                    <li>to operate, protect, improve and optimize the Platform, KidUp’s business, and our users’
                        experience, such as
                        to perform analytics, conduct research, and for advertising and marketing;
                    </li>
                    <li>to help create and maintain a trusted and safer environment on the Platform, such as fraud
                        detection and
                        prevention, conducting investigations and risk assessments, verifying the address of your
                        listings, verifying
                        any identifications provided by you, and conducting checks against databases such as public
                        government
                        databases;
                    </li>
                    <li>to send you service, support and administrative messages, reminders, technical notices, updates,
                        security
                        alerts, and information requested by you;
                    </li>
                    <li>where we have your consent, to send you marketing and promotional messages and other information
                        that may be
                        of interest to you, including information sent on behalf of our business partners that we think
                        you may find
                        interesting. You will be able to unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving these communications in
                        your settings (in
                        the “Account” section) when you login to your KidUp account;
                    </li>
                    <li>to administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events
                        sponsored
                        or managed by KidUp or our business partners; and
                    </li>
                    <li>to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes that we may have with any of our
                        users, and
                        enforce our agreements with third parties.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br/>
                <strong><em>HOW KIDUP USES AND PROCESSES USER COMMUNICATIONS</em></strong><br/><br/>
                We may review, scan, or analyze your communications with other users exchanged via the Platform for
                fraud
                prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and
                customer
                support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, the Platform may scan and
                analyze
                messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. This helps to prevent fraudulent
                actors
                from asking Guests to send them money outside of the Platform, such as by bank transfer or other money
                transfer
                methods. We may also scan, review or analyze messages for research and product development purposes to
                help make
                search, booking and user communications more efficient and effective, as well as to debug product
                offerings.
                <br/>
                <br/>We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications for sending third party marketing messages
                to you.
                We will also not sell these reviews or analyses of communications to third parties. We will also use
                automated
                methods to carry out these reviews or analyses where reasonably possible. However, from time to time we
                may have
                to manually review some communications. By using the Platform, you consent that KidUp, in its sole
                discretion,
                may review, scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether done manually or through automated
                means.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong><em>WHEN KIDUP DISCLOSES OR SHARES PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND TO WHOM</em></strong><br/>
                <strong>IMPORTANT: When you use the Platform, your data may be sent to the United States and possibly
                    other
                    countries</strong>
                We may transfer, store, use and process your information, including any Personal Information, to
                countries
                outside of the European Economic Area (&quot;
                <strong>EEA</strong>&quot;) including the United States. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to
                jurisdiction, and so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your information is transferred to
                or
                stored, used or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you
                are
                resident.
                <br/><br/>
                Your Personal Information may be disclosed as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Parts of your public profile page that contain some Personal Information may be displayed in
                        other parts of
                        the Platform to other users for marketing purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Your public Listing page will always include some minimum information such as the city and
                        neighborhood where
                        the Item is located, your public profile photo and your responsiveness in replying to Guests’
                        queries. Parts of
                        your public Listing page may be displayed in other parts of the Platform to other users for
                        marketing purposes.
                        The Platform may also display the Item’s approximate geographic location on a map, such that a
                        user can see the
                        general area of the Item.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Platform allows your public profile and public Listing pages to be included in search
                        engines, in which
                        case your public profile and public Listing pages will be indexed by search engines and may be
                        published as
                        search results. This option is enabled by default, and you may opt out of this feature by
                        changing your settings
                        on the Platform. If you change your settings or the information on your public profile or public
                        Listing pages,
                        third-party search engines may not update their databases quickly or at all. We do not control
                        the practices of
                        third-party search engines, and they may use caches containing outdated information, including
                        any information
                        indexed by the search engine before you change your settings or the information on your public
                        profile or public
                        Listing pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>When you submit a request to book an Item, your full name will become visible to the Host. We
                        will not share
                        your phone number unless there is a confirmed booking.
                    </li>
                    <li>When your request to book an Item is accepted by the Host or when you accept a Guest’s request
                        to book your
                        Item, we will disclose some of your Personal Information to the Host or Guest. However, your
                        billing information
                        will never be shared with another user.
                    </li>
                    <li>When a Guest stays at your Item or when you stay at a Host’s Item, we will ask you to review the
                        Guest or
                        the Item. If you choose to provide a review, your review may be public on the Platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>You may link your account on a third party social networking site to your KidUp account. We
                        refer to a
                        person’s contacts on these third party sites as “Friends”. When you create this linkage:

                    <ul>
                        <li>some of the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be published

                        preservation or
                        disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) respond to claims asserted against KidUp; (b) to

                <strong><em>BUSINESS TRANSFERS BY KIDUP</em></strong><br/>
                If KidUp undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets or
                bankruptcy or
                insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your Personal
                Information. In this event, we will notify you before your Personal Information is transferred and
                becomes

                <strong><em>HOW TO CHANGE OR DELETE YOUR INFORMATION, OR CANCEL YOUR KIDUP ACCOUNT</em></strong><br/>
                You may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your KidUp account by logging in
                to your
                account. If you would like to cancel your KidUp account entirely, you can do so by logging in to your
                account.
                Please also note that any reviews, forum postings and similar materials posted by you may continue to be
                publicly available on the Platform in association with your first name, even after your KidUp account is
                cancelled. <br/><br/>
                <strong><em>KEEPING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE</em></strong> <br/>
                We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your
                Personal Information against the unauthorized access, destruction or alteration of your information.
                However, no
                method of transmission over the Internet, and no method of storing electronic information, can be 100%
                secure.
                So, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your transmissions to us and of your Personal
                Information that
                we store. <br/><br/>
                <strong><em>YOUR PRIVACY WHEN YOU ACCESS THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND RESOURCES</em></strong><br/>
                The Platform will contain links to other websites not owned or controlled by KidUp. KidUp does not have
                any
                control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies, web beacons or
                other files
                on your device, or collect and solicit Personal Information from you. They will have their own rules
                about the
                collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. We encourage you to read the terms of use and
                privacy
                policies of the other websites that you visit.
                Some portions of the Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps
                API(s). Your
                use of Google Maps/Earth is subject to Google’s terms of use (located at

                <strong><em>SPECIAL FEATURES AND PROGRAMS</em></strong><br/>
                <strong>Referral service and requesting for references</strong><br/>
                The Platform provides a referral service that allows you to invite your friends and contacts to use the
                Platform. The Platform also allows you to ask your friends and contacts to write a reference for you, to
                be
                published on your KidUp profile.
                We may integrate the Platform with third party sites such as Facebook, so that you can send invitation
                messages
                or requests for references via the third party site itself. These messages will be sent by the third
                party site,
                and KidUp does not collect or retain the contact information that is used to send them.
                You may also send invitation/request emails via the Platform itself, in which case we will ask you for
                the email
                addresses to send these emails to. You can type in the email addresses manually, or you can request
                KidUp to
                import the contacts in your email account address book(s). In both cases, we will use the information
                sent to us
                for the sole purpose of sending your friends and contacts a one-time email, inviting him or her to visit
                the
                Platform or to write a reference for you. With respect to referrals, we will also store the email
                addresses of
                your invitees to track if your friend joins KidUp in response to your referral.
                If you request us to import your contacts, we will collect, but not store, the username and password for
                the
                email account you wish to import your contacts from. We will use this information only for the purpose
                of
                importing your contacts. <br/><br/>
                <strong>Meetups</strong> <br/>
                The Platform may allow registered account holders to organize, search for or participate in offline
                events
                (“<strong>Meetups</strong>”) in selected cities.
                If you organize a Meetup or indicate that you will attend one, this information, together with some of
                your
                public information (such as your profile picture and public profile page) and any messages that you post
                about
                that Meetup, will be visible to users who browse the event. However, KidUp will never disclose where you
                are
                staying to another user. <br/><br/>
                <strong>Groups</strong> <br/>
                The Platform may allow registered account holders to participate in online discussion forums (&quot;
                <strong>Group(s)</strong>”) in selected cities.
                If you join a Group, then your membership in the Group as well as some of your public information (such
                as your
                profile picture and public profile page) will be visible to users who browse the Group. If you publish
                postings
                in a Group, then your postings will be visible to such users as well. The ability to browse the Group
                will
                depend on the Group settings, and it may or may not be limited to members of that Group. <br/><br/>
                <strong><em>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</em></strong><br/>
                We may change how we collect and then use Personal Information at any time and without prior notice, at
                our sole
                discretion.
                <br/>
                <br/>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Privacy Policy,
                we will
                notify you either by posting the changed Privacy Policy on the Platform or by sending an email to you.
                We will
                also update the “Last Updated Date” at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we let you know of changes
                through an
                email communication, then the date on which we send the email will be deemed to be the date of your
                receipt of
                that email.
                It’s important that you review the changed Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed
                Privacy
                Policy, then we will not be able to continue providing the Platform to you, and your only option will be
                to stop
                accessing the Platform and deactivate your KidUp account. <br/><br/>

                will not
                exceed €6.35 in Ireland and £10 in the United Kingdom). We may also request proof of identification to
                verify

                We endeavor to keep your information accurate, complete and up to date. If your Personal Information

                data protection legislation. All requests should be addressed to our Data Protection Compliance Officer,
                KidUp

                <strong><em>COOKIE POLICY</em></strong> <br/>
                KidUp uses &quot;cookies&quot; in conjunction with the Platform to obtain information. A cookie is a
                small data
                file that is transferred to your device (e.g., your phone or your computer) for record-keeping purposes.
                For
                example, a cookie could allow the Platform to recognize your browser, while another could store your
                preferences
                and other information.
                Your browser may allow you to set how it handles cookies, such as declining all cookies or prompting you
                to
                decide whether to accept each cookie. But please note that some parts of the Platform may not work as
                intended
                or may not work at all without cookies. <br/><br/>
                <strong>KidUp cookies and third party cookies</strong><br/>
                KidUp may place our cookies on your device via the Platform. Accordingly, our Privacy Policy will apply
                to our
                treatment of the information we obtain via our cookies.
                We may also allow our business partners to place cookies on your device. For example, we use Google
                Analytics
                for web analytics, and so Google may also set cookies on your device. As further explained below, third
                parties
                may also place cookies on your device for advertising purposes.
                There are two types of cookies used on the Platform, namely “<strong>persistent cookies</strong>” and
                “<strong>session
                    cookies</strong>”.
                Session cookies will normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies will remain
                on your
                device after you close your browser, and can be used again the next time you access the Platform.
                <strong>Other technologies</strong>
                The Platform may also use other technologies with similar functionality to cookies, such as web beacons
                and
                tracking URLs to obtain Log Data about users. We may also use web beacons and tracking URLs in our
                messages to
                you to determine whether you have opened a certain message or accessed a certain link.
                <strong>Uses for KidUp cookies</strong>
                KidUp uses cookies for a number of purposes, such as the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>to enable, facilitate and streamline the functioning of the Platform across different webpages
                        and browser
                        sessions.
                    </li>
                    <li>to simplify your access to and use of the Platform and make it more seamless.</li>
                    <li>to monitor and analyze the performance, operation and effectiveness of the Platform, so that we

                </ol>
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Uses for third party cookies</strong><br/>
                Our partners’ cookies are intended to obtain information to help them provide services to KidUp. For
                example,
                third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us may track your behavior on our
                Platform to market and advertise KidUp listings or services to you on the Platform and third party
                websites.
                Third parties that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements on our
                Platform and/or third party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements by
                opting-out
                at the websites of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative (
                <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"
                   class="uri">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (<a
                    href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/"
                    class="uri">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>). You may also be able to control advertising
                cookies
                provided by publishers, for example Google’s Ad Preference Manager (
                <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/"
                   class="uri">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>). Please note that even if you choose to
                opt-out
                of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising on the Platform – it just will not
                be
                tailored to your interests.
                In addition, Facebook places a cookie via the Platform that allows Facebook to obtain aggregated,
                non-Personal
                Information to optimize their services. For example, if a user clicks on an advertisement for the KidUp
                mobile
                app on Facebook and subsequently installs the app, this cookie will inform Facebook that a user (who is
                not
                personally identified) has installed the app after clicking on the advertisement. This cookie may also
                inform
                Facebook that a user is using the app, without identifying the specific actions taken by the user in the
                app.

                <strong>Disabling Cookies</strong><br/>
                Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies
                by
                visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that
                you may
                not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the Platform. Flash
                cookies
                operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will
                not remove
                flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website (
                <a href="http://www.adobe.com/"
                   class="uri">http://www.adobe.com/</a>) and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel (<a

                <strong>Changes to this Cookie Policy</strong>
                We can change this Cookie Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Cookie Policy, we will
                let you
                know either by posting the changed Cookie Policy on the Platform or by sending you an email.
                It’s important that you review the changed Cookie Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed
                Cookie
                Policy, then we cannot continue to provide the Platform to you, and your only option is to stop
                accessing the
                Platform and deactivate your KidUp account.
